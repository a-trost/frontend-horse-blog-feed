# Frontend Horse Blog Feed

A little blogroll that displays recent posts from front-end publications.

To add a blog edit the `src\feeds.ts` file and create a PR.

Other PRs welcome!

## Potential TODOs

- [] Add pagination
- [] Add a Search (something like PageFind should work)
- [] Add directions to add blogs to the list
- [] Add YouTube channels + Designate between content types
